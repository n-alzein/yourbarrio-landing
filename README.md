This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Auth Routing and Diagnostics

- Authenticated routes live under `app/(app)` and are protected by middleware plus server layouts.
- Public routes live under `app/(public)` and always render the public shell.
- To enable client auth diagnostics, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DIAG=1` and inspect console logs for auth state transitions.

Manual Safari smoke test:
- iPhone Safari: login → open `/customer/home` → scroll for 60s → background/foreground → no public navbar flash and no blank screen.
- Unauthenticated access to `/customer/home` redirects to `/`.
- Unauthenticated access to `/business/dashboard` redirects to `/business-auth/login`.
